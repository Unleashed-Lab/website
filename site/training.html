  <main>
    <p>
    We provide multiple types of training services.
    <details>
      <summary>In-person, hosted by Unleashed Lab</summary>
      <p>
      We are in the process of creating course content focused on reverse engineering
      "new age" targets, such as malware written in Swift, Go, or Rust.
      </br></br>
      We expect to launch these in-person courses in late 2024 or early 2025. Stay tuned
      or <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> to book early seats.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Private, customer-focused, on-site</summary>
      <p>
      If you want to host a private training session internal to your company, we can
      come to you. We can deliver training sessions on various topics related to the
      <a href="services.html">services</a> we offer or we can partner with you to
      deliver custom or more advanced content.
      </br></br>
      Note: we do not provide online or video-conference training as the experience
      simply is not the same. That said, if you want to record our session for future
      internal use, we can certainly support that.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Train the trainer, customer-owned</summary>
      <p>
      If you have a need to develop training materials specific to and owned by your
      company, we can partner together to build your content. Once the content is developed
      using templates of your choice, we will follow a "train the trainer" model delivering
      the content to your team members who would be expected to deliver it going forward.
